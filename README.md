# Zork-Game-Remake
<ul>
  <li>
    Reimagined the text-based game Zork, while putting my own twist on it with new objectives and characters.
  </li>
  <li>
    Created a game-map and corresponding commands using PHP to move and pickup/use various items.
  </li>
  <li>
    Improved user experience by developing a user backend from SQL databases to enable alternative player registration &amp; login that saved game progress; added the ability to edit account details.
  </li>
</ul>
