# Zork-Game-Remake
Reimagined the text-based game Zork, while putting my own twist on it with new objectives and characters. 
Created a game-map and corresponding commands using PHP to move and pickup/use various items.
Improved user experience by developing a user backend from SQL databases to enable alternative player registration &amp; login that saved game progress; added the ability to edit account details
